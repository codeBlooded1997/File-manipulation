<h3>Generating and manipulating files using python</h3>
<p>In this project I developed two python scriped for manipulating the file in the unix os.</p>
<p>It is very useful when we want to read, write , scan and search files for specific things and compressing them.</p>

<p>All these technologies are really powerfull when the combined with webscraping, email automation and regex.</p>

<p>Also can be applied to unlimited number of files with one click.</p>

<h2>What I learned :</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Generating file by constructing data gathered from other files ( could be csv, json or raw text file).</li>
  <li>Scanning unlimited number of files to see if any of them meets a certain criteria</li>
  <li>Extracting data from files and constructing flagged files using them.</li>
  <li>moving the generated flagged files to another directory, construct the folder and make it ready for sendint through web.</li>
</ul>
